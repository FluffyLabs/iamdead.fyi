# FYI: I am dead! üòµ

# Intro

Ever wondered about the fact that YOU ARE GOING TO DIE? ‚ò†Ô∏è

In case that happens (hopefuly not too soon) you'd better be prepared. Would be great to give your loved ones access to some of your accounts (by sharing passwords) or let them "inherit" your crypto assets, by sharing the secret keys with them along with instructions how to use them.

iamdead.fyi is a tool to create your digital testament in a secure and privacy-focused way.

The code is open source and the whole stack can be self-hosted.

# How?

The idea is to write a "secret message" that chunks of will be sent to a pre-defined set of people (via email, messaging, etc) upon some configurable conditions (Proof of Life).

The message is encrypted within your browser, or for the paranoid ones, it can even be prepared on a completely off-line device and transferred via QR codes to an Internet-connected browser. The encrypted message is then split into some number of chunks using Shamir Secret Sharing.
These chunks can be "released" to selected people based on the Proof of Life conditions, that may include things like:
- social media activity
- responding to an e-mail in a timely fashion
- on-chain activity
- etc.
