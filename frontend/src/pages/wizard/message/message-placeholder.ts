To my most endearing and ever-patient family,

If you're reading this, then I've probably moved on to that great speakeasy in the sky, where the whiskey flows freely, and the parking is free - or so I hope!

Firstly, I'd like to apologize that I won't be there to see the looks on your faces, but if anyone takes a picture, I hope it's worthy of a spot next to my high school graduation one - you know, the one where I had the funny hat and that dazed expression. Typical me!

In the spirit of full transparency and because secrets are for sober people, here's a run-down of my financial escapades:

1. Assets: Well, there's a cardboard box of mismatched socks that I left under the bridge. Might fetch a few bucks if sold as modern art or to a one-legged sock enthusiast.

2. Real Estate: You remember that grand cardboard mansion in alleyway number 9? Yep, that's gone. Traded it for a limited-edition bottle of "Absolutely Not Water" vodka and three magic beans. I've planted the beans; let's see if a beanstalk sprouts. Fingers crossed!

3. Vehicles: My collection of shopping carts (all borrowed, of course) has been generously donated to the local raccoons. They've started a taxi service.

4. Investments: Invested heavily in what I believed were 'Magic Beans.' Results pending.

Now, the fun part:

1. Debts: I've left you an impressive collection of IOUs. If you put them all together, it might spell out "I'm sorry." Maybe. 

2. Parking Tickets: Ah yes, turns out shopping carts do get parking tickets. Who knew? But hey, look on the bright side, at least they weren't towed.

As for my wisdom and lessons learned, here they are:

1. Never trust a squirrel with your last peanut.
2. Always dance like no one's watching, especially if they're not, and especially if you're dancing off a debt.
3. Life's too short for cheap booze, but if it's free, always take two.

With all my sarcastic love and hopes that your lives are less of a chaotic masterpiece than mine,

P.S. If you do find any leftover booze, have a drink for me! Or three. Always take two, remember?
