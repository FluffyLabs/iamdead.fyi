export const FUNNY = `<h1>To my most endearing and ever-patient family,</h1><p><br></p><p>If you're reading this, then I've probably moved on to that great speakeasy in the sky, where the whiskey flows freely, and the parking is free - or so I hope!</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, I'd like to apologize that I won't be there to see the looks on your faces, but if anyone takes a picture, I hope it's worthy of a spot next to my high school graduation one - you know, the one where I had the funny hat and that dazed expression. Typical me!</p><p><br></p><p>In the spirit of full transparency and because secrets are for sober people, here's a run-down of my financial escapades:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Assets: Well, there's a cardboard box of mismatched socks that I left under the bridge. Might fetch a few bucks if sold as modern art or to a one-legged sock enthusiast.</li><li>Real Estate: You remember that grand cardboard mansion in alleyway number 9? Yep, that's gone. Traded it for a limited-edition bottle of "Absolutely Not Water" vodka and three magic beans. I've planted the beans; let's see if a beanstalk sprouts. Fingers crossed!</li><li>Vehicles: My collection of shopping carts (all borrowed, of course) has been generously donated to the local raccoons. They've started a taxi service.</li><li>Investments: Invested heavily in what I believed were 'Magic Beans.' Results pending.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Now, the fun part:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Debts: I've left you an impressive collection of IOUs. If you put them all together, it might spell out "I'm sorry." Maybe. </li><li>Parking Tickets: Ah yes, turns out shopping carts do get parking tickets. Who knew? But hey, look on the bright side, at least they weren't towed.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>As for my wisdom and lessons learned, here they are:</p><ol><li>Never trust a squirrel with your last peanut.</li><li>Always dance like no one's watching, especially if they're not, and especially if you're dancing off a debt.</li><li>Life's too short for cheap booze, but if it's free, always take two.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>With all my sarcastic love and hopes that your lives are less of a chaotic masterpiece than mine,</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. If you do find any leftover booze, have a drink for me! Or three. Always take two, remember?</p>`;
